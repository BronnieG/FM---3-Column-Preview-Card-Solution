## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt that it is important to start with a mobile first approach and how to work with CSS grids.  

Personally I find Grid easier and more adaptable to use than Flexbox.

I also learnt how to add hover effects on buttons with this element.

### Continued development

I want to start looking at more complex plage structures so that I can take my learning with CSS grids to the next level.

I still have a few newbie challenges to complete and will take my learnings so far into the next projects.
